This app is for the fictitious Telerik AppBuilder Coffee Company. The application lets the user find stores close to their current location, browse a list of locations, add payment cards and scroll through them. Then the user can select a card and see its balance, tap on the card image and use a barcode to pay. She can review the rewards associated with each card and use the reward card barcode to get her reward.

This app uses the [Kendo UI Mobile](http://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui-mobile "Kendo UI Mobile") framework.

The app demonstrates the following:
* Geolocation (show stores close to the current location)
* Storage (save your cards on the device)
* Kendo UI Mobile Scroll View (scroll through Payment Cards)
* Kendo UI Mobile Stretched View (Google Maps)
* Kendo UI Mobile Templates
* Kendo UI Mobile Observable Object
